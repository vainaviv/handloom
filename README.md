# TUSK: Learning to Trace and Untangling Semi-planar Knots
TUSK is a perception pipeline composed of the following components:
1. A learning-based iterative tracer
2. A cable state estimator using the tracer and a crossing classifier with a crossing correction algorithm. 
3. An analytic knot detection algorithm and untangling point selection aglorihtm given the cable state estimate.
